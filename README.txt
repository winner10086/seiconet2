The code and experimental data in this file are both real and executable, fully in line with the experimental results in the paper. The functions of each folder are as follows:
Firstly, the file "2.6. Example" corresponds to 2.6 in the paper Experiment at Example
The folder '3.3.1 Relationship experiments for evaluating ability' corresponds to the experiment in section 3.3.1 Relationship experiments for evaluating ability in the paper
The folder '3.3.2 Comparison experiments for assessment accuracy' corresponds to the experiment in section 3.3.2 Comparison experiments for assessment accuracy in the paper
The folder 'Symbolic Images' is used to symbolize the AlexNet model for execution in each set of experiments
Due to the fact that the CIFAR-10 dataset and ImageNet (ilsvrc-2012) dataset used in the paper are both standard public datasets, the folder does not contain all the images in the dataset, but includes all the images used in the experiment in the paper
The specific introduction of each folder is visible in their respective "README. txt" document
